ZoomacIt is a native macOS menu bar app inspired by [ZoomIt for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit).
The project aims for feature compatibility with ZoomIt, providing system-wide hotkeys, smooth zooming, and on-screen annotation while minimizing required permissions.

### Zoom

Press **⌃1** (Control+1) to enter Zoom mode. The screen is captured and you can zoom in/out and pan around.

#### Controls

| Mouse move | Pan |
| Scroll wheel / ↑↓ | Zoom in / out |
| Click | Enter Draw mode (zoomed view becomes the drawing canvas) |

| Right-click | Exit Zoom mode |

#### Zoom → Draw → Zoom flow

When you click in Zoom mode, you enter Draw mode on top of the zoomed view. Pressing **Escape** in Draw mode returns to Zoom mode (2-step dismiss, similar to text mode). Pressing **Escape** again exits Zoom entirely.

### Draw

Press **⌃2** (Control+2) to enter Draw mode. The screen freezes and you can draw on top of it.

#### Drawing

|---|---|
| Drag | Freehand drawing |
| Shift + Drag | Straight line |
| Control + Drag | Rectangle |
| Tab + Drag | Ellipse |
| Shift + Control + Drag | Arrow |

#### Text mode

Press **T** to enter text mode. Click anywhere to place a text field and start typing.

- **Click another position** — the current text is confirmed (rasterized) and a new text field is placed
- **Escape** — confirms the current text and returns to pen mode (Draw mode stays active)
- **Scroll wheel** — change font size
- **Color keys** (R/G/B/O/Y/P) — change text color

### Break Timer

Press **⌃3** (Control+3) to start a break timer. A full-screen countdown appears and starts immediately with the default duration (10 minutes).

#### Timer Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| ↑ | Add 1 minute |
| ↓ | Subtract 1 minute |
| R / G / B / O / Y / P | Change timer text color |
| Escape | Dismiss timer |

#### Behavior

- The timer starts immediately when the hotkey is pressed — no confirmation dialog
- Adjusting time with ↑/↓ works even during countdown
- When the timer reaches **0:00**, it stays on screen and shows elapsed time below (e.g., `0:00 (1:15)`)
- The timer continues running in the background when switching to other apps
- You can also start the timer from the menu bar icon → **Break**
- Draw mode (⌃2) and Break Timer (⌃3) can run simultaneously
